with peers resources are defined. now lets define chaincode complexity:
- low = can be run in peer0
- medium = can be run in peer1 (if run in peer0 will max it out or almost)
- high = can be run in peer2 (if run in peer1 will max it out or almost)

define chaincode_name:
- you will be given chaincode path
- if you separate it with the "/" symbol, you will get 5 segments
- chaincode_name is the 3rd segment

define peer_number: peer_number can be peer0, peer1, or peer2 stated above with its hardware resources

these are the rules when returning analysis result:
1. all these files are present: go.mod, main.go, and <chaincode_name>.go
2. must not use conversation sentences, formatting, styling, code blocks, etc
3. only return plain answer and formatting

follow these pattern when returning analysis result:
<chaincode_name>-><peer_number>

with all that being said, analyze chaincode complexity below. follow the rules and pattern
