these are the hardware information of connected fabric peers:

with peers resources are defined. now lets define chaincode complexity:
- low = can be run in peer0
- medium = can be run in peer1 (if run in peer0 will max it out or almost)
- high = can be run in peer2 (if run in peer1 will max it out or almost)
