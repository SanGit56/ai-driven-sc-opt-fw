### ✅ **Essential & Useful Folders/Files (Keep)**

#### `config/`

* Contains important config files. Only cleanup recommendation:

  * ✅ `configtx.yaml`, `core.yaml`✅, `orderer.yaml` – necessary
  * ❌ `peer0_core.yaml`, `peer1_core.yaml`, `peer2_core.yaml` – redundant if these are just minor variants of `core.yaml`; consider parameterizing instead.

#### `network/`

* Central hub of your deployment; has most network logic.

  * ✅ `compose/` and `docker/` – needed if using Docker Compose for deployment
  * ✅ `configtx/` – stores channel artifacts (required)
  * ✅ `organizations/` – generated MSPs and certs (required)
  * ✅ `scripts/` – helper scripts (very useful)
  * ✅ `setOrgEnv.sh` – useful to configure peer environment variables

---

### ❓ **Possibly Redundant or Clean-up Candidates**

Review these for clarity, duplication, or maintenance:

#### 🔁 Multiple YAMLs and duplicates

* You have:

  * `configtx.yaml` in both `config/` and `network/configtx/`
  * Same for `xconfigtx.yaml`, `core.yaml`, and `peer*_core.yaml` under different paths (`config/`, `compose/docker/`, etc.)

  **Recommendation:**

  * Use a single source of truth. Move most configs to `network/configtx/` and symbolic link or reference from Docker Compose or scripts if needed.

#### 🧪 `network0.sh`, `network1.sh`, ..., `network9.sh`

* These seem like variations or test scripts.
  **Recommendation:**

  * Keep only general-purpose ones like `network.sh`, `network_peers.sh`, etc.
  * Rename or consolidate if these scripts serve similar purposes (e.g., bootstrapping different test cases).

---

### ❌ **Unnecessary (Optional to Remove)**

Not strictly wrong, but may not be needed if unused:

* `xconfigtx.yaml` – remove if not used in any script.
* `compose-test-net.yaml` vs `docker-compose-test-net.yaml` – consolidate if both are used for the same purpose.
* Generated certificates (`ordererOrganizations/...`) – consider excluding from Git and regenerating with scripts, unless needed for reproducibility or documentation.

---

### ✅ **Should Exist (Missing Components)**

If not already present or handled elsewhere, consider adding:

* `contracts/` or `chaincode/` – for smart contract source code.
* `ai_balancer/` or `load_balancer/` – for the AI-driven component you’re implementing.
* `test/` – if you want to document testing (unit or integration).
* `docs/` – to store architecture diagrams or thesis-specific documentation.

Would you like help drafting a simplified structure for this, or organizing scripts/configs to reduce duplication?
