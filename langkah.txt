In chaincode lifecycle, complexity of chaincode mainly affects the:

1. Packaging phase ✅ (larger, more complex chaincode means bigger packages and longer install times)
2. Installation phase ✅ (idem with 1)
3. Approval phase ✅ (more complex chaincode often requires stricter endorsement policies and more thorough testing before committing)
4. Check Commit Readiness
5. Commit phase ✅ (idem with 3)
6. Instantiation, Initialization, and Execution (Invoke) phase ✅ (complex chaincode may have longer or more involved Init or setup procedures; complexity impacts endorsement execution time and resource usage on peers)


Complexity is visible in:

1. Chaincode source code size and structure
2. Resource usage during execution
3. Endorsement policy complexity tied to chaincode
